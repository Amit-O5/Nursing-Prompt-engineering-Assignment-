This document presents the conversational flow design for the Prompt Engineering Intern Assignment at Lia Plus AI.
The goal of this assignment is to simulate a virtual AI assistant that guides prospective students through the B.Sc Nursing admission process at a Nursing College. The assistant is designed to handle a variety of user intents, provide detailed program-related information, and respond appropriately to both positive and negative user inputs.
Key Focus Areas:
•	Clear and structured conversation
•	Multi-step dialogue handling
•	Context awareness and branching logic
•	Friendly, helpful, and professional tone
•	Accurate information on eligibility, fees, hostel, location, scholarships, and more
This conversation flow has been developed in alignment with the official flow diagram and meets all specified requirements, including:
•	11 key information categories
•	Positive/negative response handling
•	Graceful exits and re-engagement options
The script and flowchart together demonstrate how a well-designed AI assistant can improve the user experience, simplify complex queries, and drive engagement in educational admissions.
